## Overview

This repo is meant to be a open-source code base for building out Ethereum Wallets with Scaffold-Eth and React Native.

It uses an ejected Expo / RN base with minimal external dependencies. The wallet itself is intended to be minimalist, connecting to DApps with WalletConnect to sign transactions.

Currently being developed for iOS first.

# 🏄‍♂️ Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BuidlGuidl/scaffold-wallet.git
```

> install all dependencies:

```bash

📣 Make sure you update the `InfuraID` before you go to production. Huge thanks to [Infura](https://infura.io/) for our special account that fields 7m req/day!
